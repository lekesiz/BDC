# Task Completion Report

## Implemented WebSocket Tests for BDC Project

As outlined in DAILY_TODO_2025-05-24.md, we've successfully implemented comprehensive testing for WebSocket functionality in the BDC application. This ensures that real-time updates between clients work correctly and are properly tested.

### Completed Tasks

1. **Backend API Parity**
   - Reconciled duplicate programs blueprints by implementing:
     - `session_routes.py` for handling program sessions
     - `util_routes.py` for utility endpoints like categories and levels
     - `enrollment_routes.py` for managing program enrollments
   - Ensured full API parity between original programs blueprint and programs_v2

2. **Real-Time Flow Testing**
   - Created comprehensive tests for WebSocket event handling:
     - `program_created` event tests
     - `program_updated` event tests
     - `program_deleted` event tests
   - Verified the ProgramsListPage correctly processes these events
   - Ensured proper state updates when WebSocket events are received

3. **Frontend Data Mapping**
   - Fixed how components use program fields
   - Ensured ProgramsListPage correctly responds to WebSocket events

4. **Automated Tests**
   - Created detailed WebSocket tests:
     - `basic.test.js` for testing framework verification
     - `socket.test.jsx` for basic socket functionality testing
     - `ProgramWebSocket.test.jsx` for program-specific WebSocket testing
   - Fixed testing infrastructure issues:
     - Resolved path alias resolution problems
     - Fixed Vitest version compatibility (downgraded to v0.34.6 from v3.1.3)
     - Fixed JSX parsing errors

5. **Documentation**
   - Updated `DEVELOPING.md` with WebSocket testing strategies
   - Created `README.WebSocket.md` with detailed documentation of the WebSocket architecture
   - Created `WEBSOCKET_TESTING.md` to document the testing approach and best practices

### Technical Challenges Solved

1. **Path Alias Resolution**
   - Created proper Vitest configuration to handle path aliases like `@/components`
   - Added JSConfig to improve IDE support for path aliases

2. **Testing Framework Issues**
   - Identified and fixed compatibility issues with Vitest 3.1.3
   - Downgraded to Vitest 0.34.6 which works correctly with our code
   - Updated test scripts to use the proper Vitest commands

3. **Mock Implementation**
   - Developed comprehensive mock for Socket.IO functionality
   - Created handler tracking system to simulate real-time events
   - Implemented proper cleanup between tests to prevent cross-test contamination

### Next Steps

1. **Coverage Integration**
   - Integrate WebSocket tests into coverage reports
   - Ensure coverage meets the required thresholds

2. **CI Integration**
   - Make sure the CI pipeline correctly runs the WebSocket tests
   - Update any CI configurations if needed

3. **Expanded Testing**
   - Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases
   - Test reconnection scenarios
   - Test error handling in WebSocket events
