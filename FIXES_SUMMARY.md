# BDC Application Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. React Router v7 Future Flags Warnings
**Problem**: React Router was showing warnings about future flags for v7.
**Solution**: Added future flags to BrowserRouter configuration in `client/src/main.jsx`:
```javascript
<BrowserRouter
  future={{
    v7_startTransition: true,
    v7_relativeSplatPath: true
  }}
>
```

### 2. SQLAlchemy Backref Conflict
**Problem**: Error creating backref 'beneficiary' on relationship - property of that name exists on mapper.
**Solution**: Changed from `backref` to `back_populates` for bidirectional relationships:

- Updated `server/app/models/beneficiary.py`:
  - Changed `documents` relationship to use `back_populates`
  - Changed `evaluations` relationship to use `back_populates`
  - Changed `notes` relationship to use `back_populates`
  - Added `beneficiary` relationship in `Note` class

- Updated `server/app/models/document.py`:
  - Changed `beneficiary` relationship to use `back_populates`

- Updated `server/app/models/evaluation.py`:
  - Changed `beneficiary` relationship to use `back_populates`

## Testing

1. Created `server/test_db.py` to verify database models work correctly
2. All models and relationships are now properly configured
3. No more SQLAlchemy relationship errors

## Next Steps

1. Restart both servers:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd ~/Desktop/BDC/server
   flask run --port 5001
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd ~/Desktop/BDC/client
   npm run dev
   ```

2. The application should now work without errors!
