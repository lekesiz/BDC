# Security Vulnerability Scan Report - BDC Project

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive security scan of the BDC project identified several critical security vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. The scan covered both client-side (React/JavaScript) and server-side (Python/Flask) code, examining common security vulnerabilities including hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, XSS, authentication issues, and more.

## Critical Security Issues Found

### 1. **Hardcoded Secrets and API Keys** (CRITICAL)

**Files Affected:**
- `.env.production` - Contains placeholder values that need proper secrets
- `.env.local` and `server/.env` - Contains weak test credentials
- `config.py` - Raises errors if secrets not set but doesn't validate strength

**Issues Found:**
```
# In .env.production:
SECRET_KEY=CHANGE_THIS_TO_SECURE_SECRET_KEY_IN_PRODUCTION
JWT_SECRET_KEY=CHANGE_THIS_TO_SECURE_JWT_SECRET_IN_PRODUCTION
SECURITY_PASSWORD_SALT=CHANGE_THIS_TO_SECURE_SALT_IN_PRODUCTION
WTF_CSRF_SECRET_KEY=CHANGE_THIS_TO_SECURE_CSRF_KEY_IN_PRODUCTION

# Weak passwords in dev/test:
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test123
REDIS_PASSWORD=test123

# Exposed service credentials:
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@domain.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_stripe_secret
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-key
```

**Risk:** These placeholder values and weak credentials could be accidentally deployed to production, exposing the application to unauthorized access.

### 2. **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities** (HIGH)

While the codebase primarily uses SQLAlchemy ORM which provides protection against SQL injection, there are potential risks in:

**Potential Risk Areas:**
- Dynamic query construction without proper parameterization
- Raw SQL execution in migration files
- String formatting in queries

**Recommendation:** Always use parameterized queries and avoid string concatenation for SQL queries.

### 3. **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Protection** (MEDIUM-HIGH)

**Positive Findings:**
- Server has comprehensive input validation in `/server/app/security/input_validator.py`
- Uses bleach library for HTML sanitization
- Implements XSS pattern detection

**Issues Found:**
- Client-side uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in several React components:
  - `/client/src/components/editor/extensions/MathematicsView.jsx`
  - `/client/src/components/reports/ReportPreview.jsx`
  - `/client/src/components/reports/ReportWidget.jsx`

**Risk:** Improper use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without proper sanitization can lead to XSS attacks.

### 4. **Authentication/Authorization Issues** (HIGH)

**Issues Found:**
- JWT tokens have relatively short expiration (1 hour) but refresh tokens are valid for 30 days
- No apparent rate limiting on authentication endpoints in some areas
- Role-based access control exists but needs audit for privilege escalation

**Positive Findings:**
- JWT implementation with proper secret key handling
- Role-based access control implemented
- Password policy enforces strong passwords (12+ chars, mixed case, numbers, special chars)

### 5. **Sensitive Data Exposure** (HIGH)

**Issues Found:**
- Database connection strings with passwords in environment files
- API keys and secrets stored in plain text in configuration
- No apparent encryption for sensitive data at rest
- File uploads stored without encryption

**Positive Findings:**
- Encryption service exists (`/server/app/security/encryption_service.py`) with:
  - Argon2 for password hashing (recommended)
  - Fernet symmetric encryption
  - RSA asymmetric encryption support

### 6. **Insecure Dependencies** (MEDIUM)

**Analysis of requirements.txt:**
- Most dependencies appear to be recent versions
- Some potential concerns:
  - `eventlet==0.35.2` - Check for security advisories
  - Direct use of `psycopg2-binary` in production (should use `psycopg2`)

**Recommendation:** Run `pip audit` or `safety check` to identify known vulnerabilities.

### 7. **CORS and CSRF Protection** (MEDIUM)

**Positive Findings:**
- CSRF protection implemented in `/server/app/security/csrf_protection.py`
- CORS configuration exists with restricted origins

**Issues Found:**
- Development config has permissive CORS settings
- CSRF tokens stored in session (vulnerable to session fixation)

### 8. **File Upload Vulnerabilities** (HIGH)

**Issues Found:**
- File upload size limit of 16MB might allow DoS attacks
- File type validation based on extension only (can be spoofed)
- No apparent virus scanning
- Uploaded files stored in predictable locations

**Positive Findings:**
- Filename sanitization using `secure_filename()`
- Extension whitelist implemented

### 9. **Session Management Issues** (MEDIUM)

**Issues Found:**
- Session cookies not using all security flags in development
- No apparent session timeout mechanism
- Session fixation vulnerabilities possible

**Positive Findings:**
- Production config sets secure cookie flags:
  - `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True`
  - `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY=True`
  - `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE=Lax`

### 10. **Encryption and Hashing Weaknesses** (LOW-MEDIUM)

**Positive Findings:**
- Uses Argon2 for password hashing (industry best practice)
- Implements proper salt generation
- Supports key rotation

**Issues Found:**
- Master encryption key generation not clearly documented
- No apparent encryption for sensitive database fields
- File encryption available but not enforced

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Replace all placeholder secrets** in production configuration with strong, randomly generated values
2. **Implement proper secret management** using environment variables or secret management services (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
3. **Add input sanitization** for all `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage in React components
4. **Implement rate limiting** on all authentication endpoints
5. **Encrypt sensitive data** at rest using the existing encryption service
6. **Add virus scanning** for file uploads
7. **Implement CSP headers** to prevent XSS attacks
8. **Run dependency security audit** and update vulnerable packages

### Security Hardening Checklist:

- [ ] Enable all security headers in production
- [ ] Implement API rate limiting globally
- [ ] Add request size limits
- [ ] Enable audit logging for all sensitive operations
- [ ] Implement IP allowlisting for admin endpoints
- [ ] Add 2FA for admin accounts (already partially implemented)
- [ ] Regular security dependency updates
- [ ] Implement secure session management with timeout
- [ ] Add database query monitoring for suspicious patterns
- [ ] Implement content security policy (CSP)

## Conclusion

While the BDC project has implemented several security best practices, there are critical vulnerabilities that need immediate attention, particularly around secret management, XSS prevention, and file upload security. The existing security infrastructure provides a good foundation, but proper configuration and additional hardening measures are required before production deployment.

**Overall Security Score: 6/10** - Requires significant security improvements before production deployment.
