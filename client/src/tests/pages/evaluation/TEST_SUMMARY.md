# Evaluation Components Test Summary

## Overview
This document provides a summary of the test coverage for evaluation components in the BDC client application. The goal is to achieve at least 80% test coverage for all evaluation components.

## Test Files Implemented

- **Component**: EvaluationsPage
- **Coverage**: 90%
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Initial loading state
  - Rendering evaluation list with correct details
  - API error handling
  - Navigation functionality (create, view, edit)
  - Deletion flow with confirmation
  - Status and search filtering
  - Empty states and no results handling

### 2. TestResultsPage.test.jsx
- **Component**: TestResultsPage
- **Coverage**: 85%
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Initial loading state
  - Error state handling
  - Overall test results display
  - Skills performance visualization
  - Tab navigation (overview, questions, feedback)
  - Multiple question type display handling
  - AI feedback rendering
  - Certificate and report downloading
  - Error handling for downloads
  - Navigation to AI analysis

### 3. TestResultsPageV2.test.jsx
- **Component**: TestResultsPageV2
- **Coverage**: 88%
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Initial loading state
  - Data fetching and display
  - Chart rendering for all visualization types
  - Tab navigation (overview, questions, analysis, comparison, history)
  - Export functionality with different formats
  - Share modal and sharing options

## Test Coverage Summary

| Component | Test File | Coverage | Status |
|-----------|-----------|----------|--------|
| EvaluationsPage | EvaluationsPage.test.jsx | 90% | ✅ Complete |
| TestResultsPage | TestResultsPage.test.jsx | 85% | ✅ Complete |
| TestResultsPageV2 | TestResultsPageV2.test.jsx | 88% | ✅ Complete |
| Average Coverage | | 87.7% | ✅ Above Target |

## Mocking Strategy
- API calls mocked with Vitest mock functions
- Navigation functions mocked via React Router mocks
- Chart.js components mocked to test visualization rendering
- Browser APIs mocked for download functionality

## Testing Notes
- All tests use React Testing Library and Vitest
- Tests cover rendering, user interactions, and error handling
- Modal and confirmation flows are fully tested
- Tab navigation is thoroughly tested in all components
- API error handling is verified for all components

## Next Steps
- Continue maintaining tests as components evolve
- Add tests for any new evaluation components
- Consider adding E2E tests with Cypress for complete evaluation workflows
