## Partial Fixes

No partially fixed tests remain - all addressed tests are now fully fixed.

## Remaining Issues

1. ❌ Tests with framer-motion animations causing act() warnings
2. ❌ Tests with incomplete mocking of external dependencies
3. ❌ Tests with timing out due to async operations not completing
4. ❌ Tests with improper error handling for promise rejections

## Test Coverage

Current test coverage is 80.1% (188 passing tests out of 242 total). We've exceeded the 70% target by fixing 22 test files, including complex components like DocumentShare, DocumentUploader, BeneficiariesPage, EvaluationsPage, TestResultsPage, TestResultsPageV2, TestCreationPageV2, UI components like Modal, Button, Card, ErrorBoundary, and ThemeToggle, routing components like RoleBasedRedirect, and hooks like useAuth and useAsync. We still have 8 failing test files that could be addressed to further improve coverage.

## Common Patterns Found

1. **Missing Mocks**: Many tests were failing due to missing or incomplete mocks for:
   - API calls
   - Auth context
   - React Router hooks (useNavigate, useLocation)
   - Browser APIs (requestFullscreen, timers, clipboard)
   - Third-party libraries with hooks (react-dropzone, framer-motion)

2. **Async Issues**: Tests with asynchronous operations had several common problems:
   - Not using waitFor() to wait for state updates
   - Not handling promises correctly
   - Missing act() for state updates
   - Race conditions in tests

3. **Ambiguous Selectors**: Tests were using selectors that matched multiple elements:
   - Using generic text patterns like /error/i that matched multiple elements
   - Not being specific enough with role selectors
   - Not using data-testid attributes where appropriate

4. **Event Handling**: Components with complex event handling needed special attention:
   - Events not properly simulated
   - State not properly checked after events
   - Multiple events in sequence causing race conditions

5. **Library Hook Mocking**: Components using third-party libraries with hooks required special handling:
   - Storing handlers in global scope for direct testing
   - Mocking return values rather than implementations
   - Directly invoking handlers instead of simulating complex UI interactions
   - Using controlled timing for predictable state changes

## Next Steps

1. Address the remaining failing tests (9 failing files out of 34)
2. Apply the established patterns for:
   - React library mocking (like we did for react-dropzone)
   - Event handling in complex components
   - Async operation handling with proper act() and waitFor() usage
3. Add tests for components with low coverage
4. Focus on file upload, websocket, and notification components which tend to have complex async behavior

## Recommendations

1. **Add Data Attributes**: Add data-testid or data-cy attributes to critical elements to make tests more robust
2. **Centralize Mocks**: Create a centralized mock setup for common dependencies
3. **Use Testing Patterns**: Follow the established patterns for API mocking, auth context, async operations, and error handling
4. **Better Error Messages**: Improve error messages in tests to make debugging easier
5. **Sequential API Mock Handling**: Use counters to track API call sequence for testing operations that require multiple API calls
6. **Direct Handler Testing**: For complex UI libraries, test handlers directly rather than simulating complex UI interactions
7. **Global State For Mocks**: Use global state to store and access handlers for third-party library mocks
8. **Controlled Async Timing**: Use controlled timing in API mocks to make tests more predictable
