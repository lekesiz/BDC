## Special Considerations

### Arabic (RTL Support)
- All Arabic translations have been implemented with RTL (Right-to-Left) text direction in mind
- UI elements that require mirroring (like navigation arrows) should be handled at the component level
- Date formats follow the Arabic convention

### Turkish
- Special Turkish characters (ç, ğ, ı, ö, ş, ü) are properly used
- Formal language style is maintained throughout

### Spanish
- Latin American Spanish conventions are used
- Gender-neutral language where possible

## Recommendations

1. **Testing Required**
   - Test all translations in the actual application
   - Verify RTL layout for Arabic
   - Check for text overflow in UI components
   - Validate date/time formatting in each locale

2. **Additional Languages**
   - German (de), French (fr), Hebrew (he), and Russian (ru) files exist but need updating
   - Consider completing these translations in a future task

3. **Maintenance**
   - Implement a translation key management system
   - Consider using a translation management platform for future updates
   - Add validation to ensure all languages have the same keys

4. **Code Integration**
   - Ensure the i18n library is properly configured to load these translations
   - Implement language switching functionality if not already present
   - Add user preference storage for selected language
