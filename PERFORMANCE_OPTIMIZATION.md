# Performance Optimization Report - May 21, 2025

## 1. Bundle Analysis Implementation

### Tools Added
- Added `rollup-plugin-visualizer` to generate interactive bundle visualizations
- Configured Vite to generate detailed bundle stats
- Created an `npm run analyze` command to quickly view bundle size analysis

### Bundle Optimizations
- Configured manual code splitting for vendor libraries:
  - `react-vendor`: Core React libraries
  - `ui-vendor`: Radix UI components
  - `chart-vendor`: Charting libraries
  - `form-vendor`: Form handling libraries
  - `animation-vendor`: Animation libraries

### Benefits
- Better code splitting for improved initial load times
- More efficient caching of third-party libraries
- Reduction in main bundle size

## 2. Lighthouse CI Integration

### Tools Added
- Added `@lhci/cli` and configured Lighthouse CI
- Set up performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices testing
- Created a custom puppeteer script to test authenticated pages

### CI Commands
- Added three testing modes:
  - `npm run lighthouse`: General audit
  - `npm run lighthouse:mobile`: Mobile-specific audit
  - `npm run lighthouse:desktop`: Desktop-specific audit

### Performance Thresholds
- Performance score: Min 70/100
- Accessibility score: Min 90/100
- Best practices score: Min 85/100
- SEO score: Min 90/100
- First contentful paint: < 3000ms
- Time to interactive: < 5000ms
- Bundle size limits:
  - JavaScript: Max 500KB
  - Total resources: Max 1MB

## 3. Test Coverage Improvements

### Coverage Configuration
- Set explicit thresholds in Vitest configuration
  - Statements: 65%
  - Branches: 60%
  - Functions: 65%
  - Lines: 65%
- Added more comprehensive test reporting

### Next Steps
1. **Bundle Optimization Opportunities**
   - Reduce large dependencies (e.g., chart.js) through tree-shaking
   - Consider dynamic imports for rarely used component features
   - Remove or replace heavy dependencies in non-critical paths

2. **Lighthouse Score Improvements**
   - Implement server-side rendering for critical routes
   - Add explicit image dimensions to prevent layout shifts
   - Implement proper lazy loading for below-the-fold content

3. **Test Coverage Expansion**
   - Add more component-level tests to improve coverage
   - Focus on conditional rendering branches
   - Add API mocking for NetworkProvider tests
