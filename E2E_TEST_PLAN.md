# BDC E2E Testing Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive E2E testing strategy for the BDC application. It defines the critical user flows that need to be tested, the approach for implementing those tests, and the success criteria.

## Implemented E2E Tests

### 1. Authentication
- Login with various user roles
- Logout functionality
- Protected route access control
- Invalid credentials handling

### 2. Beneficiaries Management (Basic)
- View beneficiary list
- Basic filtering and sorting
- Access beneficiary details

### 3. Beneficiaries Management (Advanced)
- Create new beneficiary
- Edit existing beneficiary
- Filter and sort beneficiaries
- Navigate to details page

### 4. Evaluations
- View evaluation list
- Create new evaluation
- Complete evaluation forms
- Submit evaluations

### 5. Document Management
- View document list
- Upload new documents
- View documents
- Share documents with users
- Generate public links
- Download documents
- Delete documents

## Planned E2E Tests

### 6. Admin Dashboard
- **Status**: Not started
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Tests for the admin dashboard including analytics, user management, and system configuration features.

**Test Scenarios**:
- Load dashboard and verify key metrics
- Navigate between dashboard sections
- Filter/sort user lists
- Create and edit system configurations
- Access audit logs and activity reports

### 7. Reports and Analytics
- **Status**: Not started
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Tests for report generation, viewing analytics, and exporting data.

**Test Scenarios**:
- Generate different report types
- Apply filters to reports
- View data visualizations
- Export reports to different formats
- Save and retrieve saved reports

### 8. Notifications
- **Status**: Not started
- **Priority**: Low
- **Description**: Tests for the notification system including email alerts, in-app notifications, and notification preferences.

**Test Scenarios**:
- Check notification bell updates
- View notification list
- Mark notifications as read
- Change notification preferences
- Test email notification delivery (mock)

### 9. User Account Management
- **Status**: Not started
- **Priority**: High
- **Description**: Tests for user account creation, profile management, password changes, and role assignment.

**Test Scenarios**:
- Register new user
- Edit user profile
- Change password
- Upload profile picture
- Assign/change user roles
- Deactivate/reactivate accounts

### 10. Complete End-to-End Workflows
- **Status**: Partial (Basic flow implemented)
- **Priority**: High
- **Description**: Tests that cover complete user journeys involving multiple modules.

**Test Scenarios**:
- Tenant creates program → adds beneficiaries → assigns evaluators → evaluators complete evaluations → reports generated
- Admin creates user → assigns role → user logs in → performs role-specific actions
- User uploads document → shares with others → recipients access document → add comments → document updated

## Testing Approach

### Tools
- **Cypress**: Primary E2E testing framework
- **Cypress Testing Library**: For better element selection
- **cypress-axe**: For accessibility testing

### Best Practices
1. **Test Data Preparation**
   - Use cy.task for backend API calls to set up test data
   - Avoid UI interactions for test setup when possible
   - Reset application state between tests

2. **Element Selection**
   - Use data-cy attributes consistently
   - Avoid brittle selectors like CSS classes or element indices
   - Implement custom commands for frequently used operations

3. **Authentication**
   - Use cy.session for persistent login
   - Implement role-based login shortcuts
   - Test all relevant permission levels

4. **Accessibility**
   - Run accessibility checks on all major screens
   - Include checks in critical user flows
   - Check for keyboard navigation support

5. **Performance**
   - Monitor test execution time
   - Use routes/intercepts for network monitoring
   - Implement timeout retries for flaky operations

### Test Structure
Each test file should:
- Focus on a specific feature or module
- Include setup in beforeEach hooks
- Test positive flows first, then negative cases
- Include accessibility checks
- Be independent from other test files

## Integration with CI/CD
- Run tests on each pull request
- Run full suite nightly
- Generate and publish test reports
- Track code coverage
- Implement visual testing

## Success Criteria
- 90% test coverage for critical user flows
- All tests pass consistently in CI environment
- Test suite execution time under 15 minutes
- No accessibility violations (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Test failures are actionable (clear error messages)

## Next Steps
1. Implement User Account Management tests
2. Complete remaining workflow tests
3. Integrate tests with CI pipeline
4. Add visual regression testing
5. Implement performance monitoring in tests
