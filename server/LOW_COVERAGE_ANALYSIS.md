- **Key Features**: Backup creation, restoration, scheduling
- **Recommended Tests**: Backup integrity, restoration process, error handling

## Additional High-Impact Files

### Models (Lower Priority)
- **app/models/monitoring.py** (253 lines) - Some coverage
- **app/models/test.py** (308 lines) - Some coverage
- **app/models/settings.py** (205 lines) - Needs more coverage

### API Endpoints (Medium Priority)
- **app/api/calendar_enhanced.py** (287 lines) - Basic coverage
- **app/api/settings_general.py** (256 lines) - Minimal coverage
- **app/api/beneficiaries_dashboard.py** (265 lines) - Basic coverage

## Recommendations

1. **Start with Priority 1**: Focus on the completely untested files first, especially `notifications_fixed.py` which has zero coverage
2. **Use existing test patterns**: Look at well-tested modules like auth and users for test structure
3. **Focus on critical paths**: Test happy paths, error handling, and edge cases
4. **Consider integration tests**: Many of these modules interact with others, so integration tests would be valuable
5. **Mock external dependencies**: For AI services and optimization modules, mock external calls
6. **Test performance-critical code**: For optimization modules, include performance benchmarks

## Expected Coverage Improvement

Adding comprehensive tests for these 15 files could potentially:
- Increase overall code coverage by 15-25%
- Cover approximately 8,000+ lines of currently untested code
- Significantly improve confidence in critical system components
- Reduce production bugs in high-impact areas
