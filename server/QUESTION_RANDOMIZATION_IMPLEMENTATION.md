# Question Randomization Service Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive Question Randomization service for the BDC (Beneficiary Development Center) system. The service implements multiple randomization strategies to prevent cheating through pattern memorization while maintaining test fairness and educational effectiveness.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Multiple Randomization Strategies

- **Simple Random Shuffle**: Basic randomization for low-stakes assessments
- **Stratified Randomization**: Balanced distribution by difficulty/topic for formal testing
- **Deterministic Pseudo-Random**: Reproducible randomization for parallel forms
- **Adaptive Randomization**: Personalized based on user history and performance
- **Template-Based**: Pre-defined ordering patterns (easy→hard, topic-grouped, etc.)
- **Balanced Distribution**: Comprehensive balancing of all question characteristics

### 2. Question Repetition Prevention

- Tracks user question history across sessions
- Configurable lookback periods (default: 3 sessions)
- Minimum gap enforcement between question exposures
- Smart prioritization of less-exposed questions

### 3. Balanced Topic Distribution

- Ensures even coverage across subject areas
- Prevents clustering of similar topics
- Maintains educational coherence
- Configurable topic transition rules

### 4. Question Blocking Support

- **Together Blocks**: Keep related questions grouped (e.g., reading passages)
- **Apart Blocks**: Separate similar questions with minimum distance
- Flexible rule configuration per test set
- Automatic conflict resolution

### 5. Time-Based Randomization Seeds

- Daily, weekly, monthly, or hourly seed rotation
- Timezone-aware seed generation
- Consistent ordering within time windows
- Prevents pattern memorization across sessions

### 6. Question Exposure Tracking

- Real-time exposure rate monitoring
- Per-question usage statistics
- Overexposure detection and prevention
- Balanced question pool utilization

### 7. Fixed Anchor Questions

- Pin critical questions to specific positions
- Support for instructions, transitions, and conclusions
- Maintains test structure while randomizing content
- Flexible position specification (absolute or relative)

### 8. Multiple Choice Answer Randomization

- Randomize option order while preserving correct answers
- Configurable position preservation (e.g., keep "A" first)
- Pattern avoidance (prevent obvious sequences)
- Consistent randomization within sessions

### 9. Question Order Templates

- **Easy to Hard**: Progressive difficulty for confidence building
- **Hard to Easy**: Front-loading for high performers
- **Mixed Difficulty**: Balanced distribution throughout
- **Topic Grouped**: Subject-area clustering
- **Alternating Difficulty**: Rhythmic difficulty variation
- **Cognitive Progression**: Bloom's taxonomy ordering

### 10. Adaptive Testing Integration

- Seamless integration with existing adaptive test system
- IRT (Item Response Theory) parameter consideration
- Ability estimation preservation
- Enhanced question selection algorithms
