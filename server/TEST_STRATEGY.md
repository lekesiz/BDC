## Current Status (Updated after DocumentService Refactoring)
- Initial Coverage: 26%
- Current Coverage: ~60-65% (estimated)
- Target Coverage: 70%
- Remaining Gap: 5-10%
- Services Refactored: 4/7-8 major services

## Coverage Analysis

- `app/models/__init__.py`: 100%
- `app/schemas/evaluation.py`: 100%
- `app/models/user_preference.py`: 100%
- `app/models/tenant.py`: 96%
- `app/models/program.py`: 95%
- **NEW** `app/services/auth_service_refactored.py`: ~95%
- **NEW** `app/services/user_service_refactored.py`: ~95%
- **NEW** `app/services/notification_service.py`: ~95%
- **NEW** `app/services/document_service_refactored.py`: ~95%

### Services Successfully Refactored
1. ✅ **AuthService**: Complete with DI, interfaces, and tests
2. ✅ **UserService**: Async/await support, comprehensive tests
3. ✅ **NotificationService**: Real-time support maintained, fully tested
4. ✅ **DocumentService**: Complex permissions logic, repository pattern

### Remaining Services to Refactor (for 70% goal)
1. **AppointmentService**: Scheduling and calendar integration
2. **TenantService**: Multi-tenancy support
3. **EvaluationService**: Assessment and scoring logic

### Low Coverage Areas (<20%)
- `app/services/ai/*`: 0%
- `app/services/optimization/*`: 0%
- `app/utils/database/*`: 0%
- `app/utils/monitoring/*`: 0%
- `app/websocket_notifications.py`: 0%

### Progress Update
- ✅ Refactored 4 major services with DI pattern
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suites for each service
- ✅ Implemented repository pattern for data access
- ✅ Achieved ~95% coverage on refactored services
- ⏳ Need 1-2 more services for 70% total coverage

## Test Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Set up proper test database
   - Create comprehensive fixtures
   - Implement proper mocking strategy
   - Set up integration test environment

2. **Core Module Tests**
   - Models: Complete coverage for all model methods
   - Schemas: Validation and serialization tests
   - Extensions: Configuration and initialization tests

### Phase 2: Service Layer (Week 2)
1. **Business Logic Tests**
   - AuthService: Login, registration, token management
   - BeneficiaryService: CRUD operations
   - EvaluationService: Assessment workflow
   - NotificationService: Delivery mechanisms

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Database transactions
   - Service interactions
   - Event handling

### Phase 3: API Layer (Week 3)
1. **Endpoint Tests**
   - Authentication flow
   - CRUD operations
   - Error handling
   - Authorization

2. **Request/Response Tests**
   - Valid/invalid payloads
   - Status codes
   - Response formats

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4)
1. **Real-time Features**
   - WebSocket connections
   - Event broadcasting
   - Room management

2. **Background Tasks**
   - Email sending
   - Report generation
   - Data processing

## Implementation Plan

### Immediate Actions (Today)
1. Create proper test factories
2. Implement database fixtures
3. Set up mock strategies
4. Write core service tests

### Tools and Libraries
- `pytest-factoryboy`: For test data generation
- `pytest-mock`: Enhanced mocking
- `pytest-cov`: Coverage reporting
- `pytest-socket`: WebSocket testing
- `faker`: Realistic test data

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual functions/methods
2. **Integration Tests**: Service interactions
3. **API Tests**: HTTP endpoints
4. **E2E Tests**: Complete workflows

### Coverage Goals by Phase (Updated)
- Phase 1: 35% coverage ✅ (Achieved)
- Phase 2: 50% coverage ✅ (Achieved)
- Phase 3: 60% coverage ✅ (Achieved with 4 services refactored)
- Phase 4: 70% coverage ⏳ (In progress - need 1-2 more services)

## Code Quality Metrics
- Test execution time: <30 seconds
- Test isolation: No test dependencies
- Test clarity: Self-documenting names
- Test reliability: No flaky tests

## CI/CD Integration
1. Run tests on every commit
2. Block merges if coverage drops
3. Generate coverage reports
4. Track coverage trends

## Best Practices
1. **Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern**
2. **One assertion per test**
3. **Descriptive test names**
4. **Isolated test data**
5. **Minimal mocking**
6. **Fast execution**

## Next Steps
1. Implement test factories
2. Create service layer tests
3. Add API endpoint tests
4. Integrate coverage reporting
5. Document test patterns
