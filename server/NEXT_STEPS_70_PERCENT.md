# Next Steps to Achieve 70% Test Coverage

## Current Status
- **Starting Coverage**: 26%
- **Current Coverage**: ~60-65% (estimated)
- **Target Coverage**: 70%
- **Remaining Gap**: 5-10%

## Services Refactored
1. ✅ AuthService
2. ✅ UserService
3. ✅ NotificationService
4. ✅ DocumentService

## Recommendation: Refactor 1-2 More Services

Based on the current progress, refactoring 1-2 more services should get us to the 70% goal. Here are the recommended candidates:

### Option 1: AppointmentService (Recommended)
**Complexity**: High
**Coverage Impact**: ~5-7%
**Key Features**:
- Scheduling logic
- Calendar integration
- Availability checking
- Notification integration

### Option 2: EvaluationService (Recommended)
**Complexity**: Medium-High
**Coverage Impact**: ~5-6%
**Key Features**:
- Assessment creation
- Scoring logic
- Report generation
- Progress tracking

### Option 3: TenantService
**Complexity**: Medium
**Coverage Impact**: ~3-5%
**Key Features**:
- Multi-tenancy support
- Tenant isolation
- Configuration management

## Recommended Action Plan

### Step 1: Refactor AppointmentService (2-3 days)
1. Create interfaces:
   - `IAppointmentService`
   - `IAppointmentRepository`
2. Implement repository pattern
3. Create service with DI
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Create refactored API endpoints

### Step 2: Refactor EvaluationService (2-3 days)
1. Create interfaces:
   - `IEvaluationService`
   - `IEvaluationRepository`
2. Implement repository pattern
3. Create service with DI
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Create refactored API endpoints

### Step 3: Measure and Adjust (1 day)
1. Run full test suite
2. Generate coverage report
3. Identify any gaps
4. Add targeted tests if needed

## Expected Timeline
- **Total Time**: 5-7 days
- **Expected Coverage**: 70-75%

## Additional Quick Wins

If more coverage is needed after the two services:

1. **Add Missing Model Tests** (~1-2%)
   - Complete model method tests
   - Add validation tests

2. **Utility Function Tests** (~2-3%)
   - Test PDF generator
   - Test email utilities
   - Test helper functions

3. **Schema Validation Tests** (~1-2%)
   - Request validation
   - Response serialization

## Success Criteria
- ✅ 70% or higher test coverage
- ✅ All refactored services follow DI pattern
- ✅ Comprehensive test suites for each service
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ No regression in existing functionality

## Benefits After Completion
1. **Maintainability**: Easier to modify and extend
2. **Reliability**: Better test coverage reduces bugs
3. **Developer Experience**: Clear patterns and documentation
4. **Performance**: Ability to optimize with confidence
5. **Scalability**: Ready for future growth

## Conclusion
By refactoring AppointmentService and EvaluationService, we should comfortably achieve the 70% test coverage goal. The established patterns from the previous 4 services will make this process smoother and faster.
