   - Login response format
   - User list pagination format
   - Beneficiary search format
   - Appointment calendar format

2. **Error Handling (5/5)**
   - 401 Unauthorized format
   - 400 Validation error format
   - 404 Not found format
   - 500 Server error simulation

3. **Data Consistency (2/2)**

   - Beneficiary appointment consistency

4. **Filters and Sorting (3/3)**
   - User filtering by role and status
   - Appointment date filtering
   - Sorting functionality

5. **Batch Operations (2/2)**
   - Bulk notification creation
   - Bulk status update

6. **API Versioning (2/2)**
   - Version header support
   - Version in URL support

7. **Performance Hints (3/3)**
   - Field selection support
   - Include related data
   - Response compression

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **Model Field Corrections**:
   - User: `role` (not `user_type`)
   - Appointment: `start_time`/`end_time` (not `appointment_date`/`time`)
   - Report: `type` (not `report_type`)
   - Notification: `data` (not `related_data`), `read` (not `is_read`)
   - Evaluation: `trainer_id` (not `user_id`)

2. **Response Format Updates**:
   - All endpoints use `items` for lists (not `users`/`beneficiaries`)
   - Create endpoints return data in nested object
   - Pagination format standardized

3. **Authentication Improvements**:
   - Added proper tenant associations
   - Updated JWT claims to include tenant information
   - Fixed permission checks

## Test Infrastructure Established

1. **Comprehensive Fixtures**:
   - Multi-tenant setup
   - User roles and permissions
   - Realistic data relationships
   - Full entity lifecycle coverage

2. **Testing Best Practices**:
   - Response format validation
   - Error scenario coverage
   - Cross-endpoint consistency checks
   - Performance consideration tests

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living API documentation
2. **Regression Prevention**: Any breaking changes will be caught
3. **Confidence**: 100% passing tests enable safe refactoring
4. **Coverage**: Significant improvement in code coverage

## Next Steps

1. Continue adding tests for remaining endpoints
2. Add more edge case scenarios
3. Implement performance benchmarking
4. Add integration with external services
5. Set up CI/CD test automation

## Summary

The integration test suite is now a comprehensive, reliable foundation for the BDC server application. All major API functionality is tested and validated, providing confidence in the system's behavior and enabling safe future development.
