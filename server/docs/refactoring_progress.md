- Maintains same API contract as original

### 15. Comprehensive Notification Service Tests ✓
- `test_notification_service_refactored.py` - Unit tests for NotificationService
- `test_notifications_api_refactored.py` - API integration tests
- Full coverage of notification operations
- Mocked dependencies for isolation

### 16. Created Document Service Interfaces ✓
- `IDocumentService` - Document service interface
- `IDocumentRepository` - Document repository interface
- Comprehensive document and permission management methods
- Clear contracts for implementation

### 17. Implemented Document Repository ✓
- `DocumentRepository` - Handles document data access
- Supports Document and DocumentPermission entities
- Complete CRUD operations for both models
- Follows established repository pattern

### 18. Refactored DocumentService ✓
- Created `DocumentService` with dependency injection
- Uses multiple repositories (Document, User, Beneficiary)
- Integrates with NotificationService
- Maintains all permission checking logic
- Improved error handling and logging

### 19. Updated DI Container for Documents ✓
- Added DocumentRepository registration
- Added DocumentService registration
- Factory methods with proper dependency injection
- Integrates with existing services

### 20. Created Refactored Document Endpoints ✓
- `documents_refactored.py` - New document endpoints using DI
- Complete document management API
- Permission management endpoints
- File upload support
- Maintains same API contract as original

### 21. Comprehensive Document Service Tests ✓
- `test_document_service_refactored.py` - Unit tests for DocumentService
- `test_document_repository.py` - Unit tests for DocumentRepository
- `test_documents_api_refactored.py` - API integration tests
- Full coverage of permission logic
- Mocked dependencies for isolation

## Key Improvements

1. **Testability**: Services can be tested in isolation with mocks
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations
4. **Documentation**: Interfaces serve as contracts
5. **Coverage**: Path to 70%+ test coverage

## Architecture Changes

### Before:
```
API Endpoints → Services → Direct DB Access
(Tightly coupled, hard to test)
```

### After:
```
API Endpoints → DI Container → Service Interfaces → Repositories
(Loosely coupled, highly testable)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Refactor Remaining Services** ⏳
   - Document Service
   - AppointmentService  
   - TenantService
   - Other services

2. **Complete API Migration**
   - Migrate remaining endpoints to use DI
   - Ensure all endpoints use refactored services
   - Remove legacy code

3. **Update All API Endpoints**
   - Migrate to use DI container
   - Create refactored versions
   - Enable gradual rollout

4. **Improve Test Coverage**
   - Target 70% overall coverage
   - Focus on critical paths
   - Add integration tests

5. **Documentation**
   - Update API documentation
   - Create architecture diagrams
   - Document migration process

## Migration Strategy

1. Run old and new endpoints in parallel
2. Use feature flags for gradual rollout
3. Monitor performance and errors
4. Migrate traffic progressively
5. Remove old code once stable

## Metrics to Track

- Test coverage percentage
- Number of failing tests
- Code complexity scores
- Dependency coupling metrics
- Performance benchmarks

## Conclusion

The refactoring is progressing well. We've established a solid foundation with the auth service that can be replicated across other services. The dependency injection pattern significantly improves testability and will help achieve the 70% coverage goal.
