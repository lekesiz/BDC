# Phase 5: Performance Improvements Implementation Plan

## Overview
Phase 5 focuses on optimizing the BDC application's performance through various techniques including code splitting, lazy loading, caching, and bundle optimization.

## Performance Improvements Categories

### 1. Bundle Optimization
- Code splitting for smaller initial bundle
- Dynamic imports for route-based splitting
- Tree shaking for unused code removal
- Production build optimizations

### 2. Lazy Loading
- Route-based lazy loading
- Component-level lazy loading
- Image lazy loading
- Intersection Observer for visibility detection

### 3. Caching Strategy
- API response caching
- Browser cache optimization
- Service Worker implementation
- Local storage for user preferences

### 4. Rendering Optimization
- React.memo for component memoization
- useMemo and useCallback optimization
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Debouncing and throttling

### 5. Network Optimization
- Request batching
- Data prefetching
- Compression (gzip/brotli)
- CDN integration

### 6. Performance Monitoring
- Core Web Vitals tracking
- Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Performance budgets
- Automated performance testing
