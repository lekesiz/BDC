## Upcoming Tasks

1. **High Priority**
   - [x] Implement E2E tests for document management
   - [x] Implement E2E tests for user account management
   - [x] Add tests for beneficiary components to reach 80% coverage
   - [ ] Add tests for evaluation components to reach 80% coverage

2. **Medium Priority**
   - [ ] Implement dashboard component tests
   - [ ] Add visual regression tests
   - [ ] Improve API service test coverage

3. **Low Priority**
   - [ ] Add settings component tests
   - [ ] Add performance benchmark tests
   - [ ] Create comprehensive test documentation

## Integration Testing Progress

| Integration Area | Status | Coverage |
|------------------|--------|----------|
| Document Components + API | ✅ Complete | 85% |
| Authentication + User Management | 🔄 In Progress | 60% |
| Beneficiary Components + API | 🔄 In Progress | 55% |
| Evaluation Components + API | 🔄 In Progress | 50% |
| Dashboard + Data Services | ⏳ Not Started | 0% |

## Notes

- The focus has been on building a solid testing infrastructure and achieving high coverage for the document management components, which were previously untested.
- We've successfully implemented comprehensive tests for all document components, establishing patterns that can be applied to other areas of the application.
- E2E testing with Cypress is now configured and proving valuable for testing key workflows.
- Next steps will focus on increasing coverage for beneficiary and evaluation components while maintaining the high standards established for document components.
