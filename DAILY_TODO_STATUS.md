# DAILY TODO Status – 24 May 2025

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Backend API parity
- ✅ 1.1 Add `/api/programs/<id>/students` endpoint - Implemented in detail_routes.py
- ✅ 1.2 Update `Program.to_dict()` to include `duration_weeks` - Added to Program model
- ✅ 1.3 Expose `GET /api/programs/<id>/enrollments` in programs_v2 - Implemented in detail_routes.py
- ✅ 1.4 Reconcile duplicate programs blueprints - Added session_routes.py, util_routes.py, enrollment_routes.py

### 2. Real-time flow
- ✅ 2.1 Frontend: Removed early return in SocketContext.jsx & NotificationProviderV2.jsx
- ✅ 2.2 Added listeners for program events (created, updated, deleted)
- ✅ 2.3 Implemented program list refresh when WebSocket events occur

### 3. Frontend data mapping fixes
- ✅ 3.1 ProgramDetailPage uses program.duration_weeks properly
- ✅ 3.2 Replaced with new `/students` endpoint
- ✅ 3.3 EditProgramModal handles all required fields: description, category, level, status

### 4. Automated tests
- ✅ 4.1 Backend: Created comprehensive tests for `/students` endpoint
- ✅ 4.2 Frontend: Implemented WebSocket tests for program events

### 5. CI & docs
- ✅ 5.1 Updated coverage expectations for tests
- ✅ 5.2 Updated documentation in DEVELOPING.md and added new docs: README.WebSocket.md and WEBSOCKET_TESTING.md

## Notes

1. Backend API parity is now complete. The programs_v2 API now has full feature parity with the original programs API, including:
   - Full program CRUD operations
   - Module management
   - Session scheduling
   - Enrollment management
   - Utility endpoints for metadata

2. WebSocket functionality is now properly tested on both backend and frontend. Tests verify:
   - Program creation events
   - Program update events
   - Program deletion events
   - Proper UI refresh when events are received

3. Frontend components properly use the new API endpoints and display the correct data:
   - ProgramDetailPage shows program.duration_weeks correctly
   - Student list uses the new /students endpoint
   - EditProgramModal supports all required fields
