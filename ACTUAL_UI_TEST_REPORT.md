# BDC UI Test Report - Actual Execution
## Date: 16/05/2025

## Test Environment
- Server: http://localhost:5001 ✅ Running
- Client: http://localhost:5173 ✅ Running

## Test Tools Created
1. **ui-test-runner.html** - Browser-based test runner for login/logout testing
2. **test-navigation.html** - Quick navigation links and auth check
3. **test-auth.html** - Basic authentication test (previously created)

## Key Findings

### 1. Login Functionality
- ✅ All users can login successfully via API
- ✅ JWT tokens are generated and stored properly
- ✅ Authentication headers are set correctly

### 2. Routing Architecture

#### Current Route Structure:
- `/` - Protected route, renders DashboardPageV3 (all authenticated users)
- `/portal` - Student portal routes (exists but not auto-redirected)
- `/dashboard` - Not a valid route (results in 404)

#### Issues Identified:
1. **No automatic role-based redirection** - Students are not automatically redirected to `/portal`
2. **Dashboard route confusion** - `/dashboard` doesn't exist, but it's referenced in test scenarios
3. **All users land on the same page** - DashboardPageV3 is shown to all roles

### 3. Student Portal

The student portal exists at `/portal` with the following sub-routes:
- `/portal` - Portal dashboard (PortalDashboardV3)
- `/portal/courses` - Course listing
- `/portal/calendar` - Student calendar
- `/portal/resources` - Learning resources
- `/portal/achievements` - Student achievements
- `/portal/profile` - Student profile
- `/portal/progress` - Progress tracking
- `/portal/assessment` - Assessments

**Issue**: Students must manually navigate to `/portal` after login.

### 4. Menu Structure

Based on code review, the sidebar menu should show different items based on roles:
- **Super Admin**: All menu items
- **Tenant Admin**: Limited admin features
- **Trainer**: Beneficiary and evaluation focused items
- **Student**: Portal-specific menu items

### 5. Authentication Flow

Current flow:
1. User logs in at `/login`
2. After successful login, user is redirected to `from` location or default `/`
3. `/` route shows DashboardPageV3 for all authenticated users
4. No automatic role-based redirection

## Recommendations

### 1. Implement Role-Based Routing

Create a component to handle initial routing based on user role:

```jsx
// Create a RoleBasedRedirect component
const RoleBasedRedirect = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  
  if (user?.role === 'student') {
    return <Navigate to="/portal" replace />;
  }
  
  return <DashboardPageV3 />;
};

// Update App.jsx
<Route index element={<RoleBasedRedirect />} />
```

### 2. Fix Dashboard Route

Either:
- Add a `/dashboard` route that redirects to `/`
- Update all references from `/dashboard` to `/`

### 3. Update Login Redirect Logic

Modify LoginPage to redirect based on role:

```jsx
const getRedirectPath = (user) => {
  if (user.role === 'student') return '/portal';
  return '/';
};

// In handleSubmit
navigate(getRedirectPath(user), { replace: true });
```

### 4. Create Proper Test Pages

1. **Manual Login Test Page** - Simple form to test each user
2. **Navigation Test Page** - Verify menu items for each role
3. **Permission Test Page** - Test access to restricted routes

## Test Execution Summary

### Completed:
- ✅ Created test tools (ui-test-runner.html, test-navigation.html)
- ✅ Verified API authentication works
- ✅ Identified routing issues
- ✅ Documented portal structure

### Not Completed (Due to Architecture Issues):
- ❌ Automatic student portal redirect test
- ❌ Role-based menu visibility test (requires manual UI inspection)
- ❌ Dashboard navigation test (route doesn't exist)

## Next Steps

1. **Implement role-based routing** - Priority 1
2. **Fix dashboard route references** - Priority 2
3. **Create automated UI tests** - Priority 3
4. **Update documentation** - Priority 4

## Conclusion

The authentication system works correctly at the API level, but the frontend lacks proper role-based routing. Students can access their portal at `/portal`, but they must navigate there manually. The system needs architectural improvements to automatically route users based on their roles.
