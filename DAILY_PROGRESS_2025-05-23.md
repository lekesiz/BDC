### Technical Achievements 🏆

1. **High-Quality Refactoring**
   - Both services achieved >85% test coverage
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Testable architecture

2. **Problem Solving**
   - Fixed complex model import issues
   - Resolved SQLAlchemy mock challenges
   - Handled Flask app context in tests

3. **Best Practices**
   - Repository pattern ready
   - SOLID principles applied
   - Comprehensive error handling

### Challenges Faced & Resolved 🔧

1. **Model Import Confusion**
   - Issue: Question, TestSession in wrong file
   - Solution: Updated imports to use test.py

2. **Mock Configuration**

   - Solution: Added try-catch for logging

### Next Steps 📋

#### Tomorrow (Priority Order)
1. **Integration Testing** (Morning)
   - Test refactored services with real API calls
   - Verify database transactions
   - Test error scenarios

2. **Frontend Connection** (Afternoon)
   - Ensure API compatibility
   - Test with real frontend
   - Fix any integration issues

3. **More Service Refactoring** (If time permits)
   - ProgramService
   - CalendarService
   - Start on remaining services

#### This Week
- Reach 40% overall test coverage
- Complete all service refactoring
- Fix frontend tests
- Begin performance testing

### Code Quality Score
- **Yesterday**: 4/10
- **Today**: 6/10
- **Target**: 8/10

### Time Spent
- Service Refactoring: ~4 hours
- Test Writing: ~3 hours
- Debugging: ~2 hours
- Documentation: ~1 hour

### Blockers
- Frontend tests still broken (memory issues)
- Some API endpoints not fully tested
- WebSocket functionality untested

### Recommendations
1. Continue aggressive refactoring pace
2. Focus on integration tests tomorrow
3. Start fixing frontend tests this week
4. Consider adding CI/CD pipeline

### Developer Notes
- Refactored services are significantly cleaner
- Test patterns established for other services
- Good momentum - keep pushing!
