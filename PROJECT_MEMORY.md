## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **Real-time**: Socket.io
- **Architecture**: Multi-tenant SaaS

## Key Features Implemented
1. Complete user authentication system
2. Multi-tenant architecture
3. Role-based access control
4. Beneficiary management
5. Program management with scheduling
6. Test engine with multiple question types
7. Calendar with Google integration
8. Document management with templates
9. Real-time messaging
10. Reports and analytics

## Development Servers
- Frontend: http://localhost:5174
- Backend: http://localhost:5001

## File Structure
- `/client` - React frontend application
- `/server` - Flask backend application
- `/docs` - Documentation
- `PROJECT_CHECKLIST.md` - Master task list
- `PROJECT_PROGRESS.json` - Progress tracking
- `checklist_manager.py` - CLI tool for managing tasks

## Architectural Decisions
1. **Multi-tenant System**: Schema isolation for each tenant
2. **Real-time Features**: Socket.io for messaging
3. **File Storage**: Local filesystem with plans for cloud migration
4. **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
5. **Frontend State**: React Query + Context API

## Known Issues
1. Frontend needs to handle token refresh automatically
2. File upload size limits need to be configured
3. WebSocket connection needs reconnection logic
4. Some V2 pages need to replace V1 versions

## Key Dependencies
- Flask 2.x
- SQLAlchemy 2.x
- React 18.x
- Socket.io 4.x
- Tailwind CSS 3.x

## Migration Notes
- Database uses SQLite for development
- Will migrate to PostgreSQL for production
- Redis needed for production caching
- File storage will move to S3/cloud

## Security Considerations
1. All API endpoints require authentication
2. Role-based permissions enforced at API level
3. Input validation on all forms
4. XSS protection in React
5. CSRF protection needed for forms
6. Rate limiting on API endpoints
7. File upload validation required

## Session 2025-05-19
### Context
Starting new intensive development session with goal to implement CI quality gates and begin modular backend refactor.

### Plan (see DAILY_TODO_2025-05-19.md)
1. Baseline test runs (backend & frontend).
2. Add pre-commit hooks: black, isort, flake8, bandit, eslint, prettier.
3. Configure GitHub Actions workflow for automated tests and lint.
4. Refactor backend: extract beneficiaries API into subpackage; adjust blueprints.
5. Re-run tests and ensure server healthy.
6. Record progress and next steps.

### Notes
- Memory entries will be added before and after each major task to track progress.
- DAILY_TODO_2025-05-19.md will serve as ticking checklist.

### Progress 2025-05-19 10:00
- Added `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with Python and JS linters/formatters.
- Created GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for backend and frontend tests + lint.
- Updated DAILY_TODO_2025-05-19.md tasks 4 & 5 to done.
- Deferred local baseline tests due to Python 3.13 package issues; CI will handle.

### Progress 2025-05-19 11:00
- Created modular package `app/api/beneficiaries_v2` with blueprint and first GET endpoint.
- Updated `register_blueprints` to use new blueprint; old beneficiaries blueprint no longer registered.
- Daily TODO tasks 6 and 7 marked complete.
- Deferred task 8 (backend test rerun) due to local env; will rely on CI.
