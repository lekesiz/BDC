## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **Real-time**: Socket.io
- **Architecture**: Multi-tenant SaaS

## Key Features Implemented
1. Complete user authentication system
2. Multi-tenant architecture
3. Role-based access control
4. Beneficiary management
5. Program management with scheduling
6. Test engine with multiple question types
7. Calendar with Google integration
8. Document management with templates
9. Real-time messaging
10. Reports and analytics

## Development Servers
- Frontend: http://localhost:5174
- Backend: http://localhost:5001

## File Structure
- `/client` - React frontend application
- `/server` - Flask backend application
- `/docs` - Documentation
- `PROJECT_CHECKLIST.md` - Master task list
- `PROJECT_PROGRESS.json` - Progress tracking
- `checklist_manager.py` - CLI tool for managing tasks

## Architectural Decisions
1. **Multi-tenant System**: Schema isolation for each tenant
2. **Real-time Features**: Socket.io for messaging
3. **File Storage**: Local filesystem with plans for cloud migration
4. **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
5. **Frontend State**: React Query + Context API

## Known Issues
1. Frontend needs to handle token refresh automatically
2. File upload size limits need to be configured
3. WebSocket connection needs reconnection logic
4. Some V2 pages need to replace V1 versions

## Key Dependencies
- Flask 2.x
- SQLAlchemy 2.x
- React 18.x
- Socket.io 4.x
- Tailwind CSS 3.x

## Migration Notes
- Database uses SQLite for development
- Will migrate to PostgreSQL for production
- Redis needed for production caching
- File storage will move to S3/cloud

## Security Considerations
1. All API endpoints require authentication
2. Role-based permissions enforced at API level
3. Input validation on all forms
4. XSS protection in React
5. CSRF protection needed for forms
6. Rate limiting on API endpoints
7. File upload validation required

## Daily TODO Completion - 23 Mayıs 2025

### Backend API Alignment - Tamamlandı ✅
1. ✅ `/api/programs/<id>/students` endpoint'i zaten mevcut (hem programs.py hem programs_v2'de)
2. ✅ `Program.to_dict()` zaten `duration_weeks` field'ını içeriyor
3. ✅ `GET /api/programs/<id>/enrollments` endpoint'i mevcut 
4. ✅ DELETE endpoint eklendi ve WebSocket event emission implementasyonu

### Real-time Flow - Tamamlandı ✅  
1. ✅ Socket.IO zaten aktif (early return'ler yoktu)
2. ✅ Program real-time events eklendi:
   - `program_created` - Yeni program oluşturulduğunda
   - `program_updated` - Program güncellendiğinde  
   - `program_deleted` - Program silindiğinde
3. ✅ Frontend event listener'ları eklendi:
   - ProgramDetailPage için real-time update/delete handling
   - ProgramsListPage için real-time list refresh

### Frontend Data Mapping - Tamamlandı ✅
1. ✅ ProgramDetailPage zaten `duration_weeks` kullanıyor
2. ✅ `/students` endpoint zaten mevcut ve kullanılıyor
3. ✅ EditProgramModal zaten full field set destekliyor (description, category, level, status, vs.)

### Automated Tests - Tamamlandı ✅
1. ✅ Backend WebSocket test eklendi: `test_program_websocket.py`
2. ✅ Frontend WebSocket integration test eklendi: `ProgramWebSocketIntegration.test.jsx`
3. ✅ Mock'lar ve test infrastructure hazırlandı

### CI & Documentation - Tamamlandı ✅
1. ✅ README.md güncellendi (WebSocket test komutları eklendi)
2. ✅ DEVELOPING.md zaten güncel WebSocket documentation içeriyor
3. ✅ CI configuration'da coverage expectations mevcut

### Implementasyon Detayları:

**Backend Socket.IO Events:**
```python
# Program CRUD operations emit WebSocket events
emit_to_tenant(tenant_id, 'program_created', {
    'program': program.to_dict(),
    'message': f'New program "{program.name}" has been created'
})
```

**Frontend Real-time Integration:**
```javascript
// Socket events trigger custom browser events
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('programCreated', { detail: program }));

// Components listen to these events for auto-refresh
window.addEventListener('programCreated', handleProgramCreated);
```

**Sonuç:**
Daily TODO'daki tüm görevler başarıyla tamamlandı. Program backend-frontend alignment sağlandı, real-time updates end-to-end çalışıyor, ve test infrastructure hazır.
- Increase test coverage to 70%+
