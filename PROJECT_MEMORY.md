## Development Servers
- Frontend: http://localhost:5174
- Backend: http://localhost:5001

## File Structure
- `/client` - React frontend application
- `/server` - Flask backend application
- `/docs` - Documentation
- `PROJECT_CHECKLIST.md` - Master task list
- `PROJECT_PROGRESS.json` - Progress tracking
- `checklist_manager.py` - CLI tool for managing tasks

## Architectural Decisions
1. **Multi-tenant System**: Schema isolation for each tenant
2. **Real-time Features**: Socket.io for messaging
3. **File Storage**: Local filesystem with plans for cloud migration
4. **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
5. **Frontend State**: React Query + Context API

## Known Issues
1. Frontend needs to handle token refresh automatically
2. File upload size limits need to be configured
3. WebSocket connection needs reconnection logic
4. Some V2 pages need to replace V1 versions

## Key Dependencies
- Flask 2.x
- SQLAlchemy 2.x
- React 18.x
- Socket.io 4.x
- Tailwind CSS 3.x

## Migration Notes
- Database uses SQLite for development
- Will migrate to PostgreSQL for production
- Redis needed for production caching
- File storage will move to S3/cloud

## Security Considerations
1. All API endpoints require authentication
2. Role-based permissions enforced at API level
3. Input validation on all forms
4. XSS protection in React
5. CSRF protection needed for forms
6. Rate limiting on API endpoints
7. File upload validation required

1. ‚úÖ ProgramDetailPage zaten `duration_weeks` kullanƒ±yor
2. ‚úÖ `/students` endpoint zaten mevcut ve kullanƒ±lƒ±yor
3. ‚úÖ EditProgramModal zaten full field set destekliyor (description, category, level, status, vs.)

### Automated Tests - Tamamlandƒ± ‚úÖ
1. ‚úÖ Backend WebSocket test eklendi: `test_program_websocket.py`
2. ‚úÖ Frontend WebSocket integration test eklendi: `ProgramWebSocketIntegration.test.jsx`
3. ‚úÖ Mock'lar ve test infrastructure hazƒ±rlandƒ±

### CI & Documentation - Tamamlandƒ± ‚úÖ
1. ‚úÖ README.md g√ºncellendi (WebSocket test komutlarƒ± eklendi)
2. ‚úÖ DEVELOPING.md zaten g√ºncel WebSocket documentation i√ßeriyor
3. ‚úÖ CI configuration'da coverage expectations mevcut

### Implementasyon Detaylarƒ±:

**Backend Socket.IO Events:**
```python
# Program CRUD operations emit WebSocket events
emit_to_tenant(tenant_id, 'program_created', {
    'program': program.to_dict(),
    'message': f'New program "{program.name}" has been created'
})
```

**Frontend Real-time Integration:**
```javascript
// Socket events trigger custom browser events
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('programCreated', { detail: program }));

// Components listen to these events for auto-refresh
window.addEventListener('programCreated', handleProgramCreated);
```

**Sonu√ß:**
Daily TODO'daki t√ºm g√∂revler ba≈üarƒ±yla tamamlandƒ±. Program backend-frontend alignment saƒülandƒ±, real-time updates end-to-end √ßalƒ±≈üƒ±yor, ve test infrastructure hazƒ±r.
- Increase test coverage to 70%+
- Set up monitoring (APM, error tracking)
- Implement security hardening features
- Complete API documentation
- Fix production deployment automation

## Current Priority Tasks (Week 1)
1. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Real deployment scripts, staging env
2. **Missing APIs**: availability, settings, assessment/templates
3. **Security**: IP whitelisting, rate limiting, headers
4. **Testing**: Coverage 50% ‚Üí 70%, E2E with Cypress

## Added programs_v2 package progress
