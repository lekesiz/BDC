# BDC Project - Testing Infrastructure Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the testing infrastructure improvements that have been implemented to increase test coverage, improve code quality, and ensure the application is production-ready.

## 1. End-to-End Testing with Cypress

### Setup
- Configured Cypress with `cypress.config.js`
- Created custom commands in `support/commands.js`
- Set up e2e support utilities in `support/e2e.js`

### New E2E Tests
- Authentication flows (`auth.cy.js`)
- Beneficiary management (`beneficiaries-advanced.cy.js`)
- Evaluation system (`evaluations.cy.js`)
- Complete user journey

### Running E2E Tests
```bash
# Open Cypress interface
npm run cy:open

# Run headless
npm run cy:run

# Run with test server automatically started
npm run test:e2e
```

## 2. Frontend Unit & Component Testing

### Test Infrastructure
- Using Vitest for unit/component testing
- Added more comprehensive tests for critical components:
  - Error handling components (`ErrorBoundary.test.jsx`)
  - Async data loading (`AsyncData.test.jsx`)
  - Custom hooks (`useAsync.test.js`)

### Coverage Goals
- Current frontend test coverage: ~50%
- Target coverage: 70%+
- Added `test:coverage` command for generating detailed coverage reports

## 3. Backend Security Testing

### Enabled Security Tests
- Enabled previously disabled security tests: `test_security_encryption.py`
- Created dedicated script to run security-specific tests: `run_security_tests.py`

### Security Test Focus Areas
- Authentication & Authorization
- Input validation
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection
- CSRF protection
- Data encryption

## 4. Comprehensive Test Runner

Created a unified test runner script (`run_all_tests.sh`) that:

1. Runs backend unit tests with coverage
2. Executes security-specific tests
3. Runs frontend component tests
4. Generates frontend coverage reports
5. Runs linting checks
6. Executes end-to-end tests
7. Generates a comprehensive test report

### Usage

```bash
./run_all_tests.sh
```

### Output
- Detailed test report saved to `TEST_REPORT_[TIMESTAMP].md`
- Coverage report locations
- List of failing tests and areas for improvement

## 5. Next Steps

1. **Increase Backend Coverage**
   - Target: >70% (current: ~65%)
   - Focus on critical service modules

2. **Increase Frontend Coverage**
   - Target: >70% (current: ~50%)
   - Add tests for all new components

3. **Expand E2E Test Suite**
   - Add tests for all critical user journeys
   - Add accessibility testing to all pages

4. **Integration with CI/CD**
   - Run tests on every commit
   - Make PR approvals dependent on test results
   - Set up automated test reports
