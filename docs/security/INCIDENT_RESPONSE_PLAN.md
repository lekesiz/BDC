   kubectl logs -f deployment/bdc-backend | grep -i "security"
   tail -f /var/log/security.log | grep -E "(CRITICAL|ERROR)"
   ```

2. **Initial Assessment**
   - Verify incident scope and impact
   - Determine severity level
   - Document initial findings
   - Activate response team

3. **Stakeholder Notification**
   ```

   INCIDENT ID: INC-YYYY-MMDD-NNNN
   SEVERITY: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
   DETECTED: [Time/Date]
   AFFECTED SYSTEMS: [List]
   INITIAL IMPACT: [Description]
   ASSIGNED IC: [Name]
   ```

### Phase 2: Containment (15 minutes - 2 hours)

#### Short-term Containment
1. **System Isolation**
   ```bash
   # Isolate affected pods
   kubectl patch deployment bdc-backend -p '{"spec":{"replicas":0}}'
   
   # Block suspicious IPs
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: block-suspicious-ip
   spec:
     podSelector: {}
     policyTypes:
     - Ingress
     ingress:
     - from: []
       except:
       - ipBlock:
           cidr: SUSPICIOUS_IP/32
   EOF
   ```

2. **Evidence Preservation**
   ```bash
   # Create memory dump
   kubectl exec -it pod-name -- gcore $(pgrep -f app_process)
   
   # Preserve logs
   kubectl logs deployment/bdc-backend > incident-logs-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log
   
   # Backup database state
   pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > db-backup-incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql
   ```

3. **Access Revocation**
   ```bash
   # Revoke compromised tokens
   redis-cli FLUSHDB  # Clear session cache
   
   # Force password reset for affected users
   python3 manage.py force_password_reset --user-id AFFECTED_USERS
   ```

#### Long-term Containment

   # Analyze network traffic
   tcpdump -r incident-traffic.pcap | grep SUSPICIOUS_IP
   ```

2. **Vulnerability Assessment**
